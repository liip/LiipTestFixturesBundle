Installation
============

 1. Download the Bundle

    Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
    following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

    ```bash
    $ composer require --dev liip/test-fixtures-bundle:^2.0.0
    ```
    
    >**Note** If you use Symfony 3.4, see the [documentation for 1.x](https://github.com/liip/LiipTestFixturesBundle/blob/1.x/README.md).

    This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
    in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
    of the Composer documentation.

 2. Enable the Bundle only in the test environment

    Update the relevant line in the `config/bundles.php` file to enable this bundle only
    for the `test` environment:

    ```diff
     return [
    -    Liip\TestFixturesBundle\LiipTestFixturesBundle::class => ['dev' => true, 'test' => true],
    +    Liip\TestFixturesBundle\LiipTestFixturesBundle::class => ['test' => true],
     ];
    ```
